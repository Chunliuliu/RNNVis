# Architecture design of this project

The project contains code running in the back-end (python flask and TensorFlow) and front-end (using Vue.js framework)

This two part of code should be formed as two projects as loosely coupled as possible.

## Server Code

Server code manages under `./py` directory.

## Front-End

Under `./rnnvis` directory
